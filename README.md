# keylogger
This is the first Keylogger that I have written, It currently only saves all the keystrokes using in a text file, the areas for improvement are , the keylogger must automatically take read and write permission so that it be run from anywhere on the computer, secondly it must have an ability to send the text file over and email, whenever a certain amount of keystrokes are made.
